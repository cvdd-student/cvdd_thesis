    The boat runs a speed of t for (T - t) seconds where T = time, resulting in
    a distance of t * (T - t). The formula d(t) = t * (T - t) = Tt - tÂ² is zero
    at 0 and T and symmetric between.

    Use a binary search to find the smallest t such that d(t) > distance. During
    the search, low will always be less than t while high will always be greater
    than or equal than t. At the end of the search, high represents the smallest
    t such that d(t) > distance.

    We want the number of records. If first is the smallest t such that d(t) >
    distance and last is the greatest t such that d(t) > distance, then the
    number of records is (last - first + 1). Because of symmetry last = time / 2
    + time / 2 - first = time - first. The number of records can therefore be
    calculated as (last - first + 1) = time - 2*first + 1.

    ## Example:

    >>> find_num_records(8, 12)
    3
    """
    low, high = 0, time // 2
